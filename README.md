# BankingSystemAPI-latest
As In-Memory database has been used, first we have to create new user account through "AddUser" endpoint (OpenAPI) in BankingOperationsController.After that we can perform other operations.
Didn't use asynchronous programming here because it would add complexity as I was working with in memory list based data structure. In actual enterprise app, async operations becomes a must.
